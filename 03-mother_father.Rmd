# The Mother and the Father



<!-- in the archetypal framework, masculine and féminine refer not to the real sexes but rather to features of the two primordial archetypes, the father and the mother.  -->



<!-- need and goal, the mother needs protection and achieves creation (by being turned toward the internal) , the father achieves protection and goes toward the external unknown. image of the two serpents, one facing the outside as a ring of protection, the other facing the inside -->

<!-- wo fundamental archetypes: Father and Mother. Protection and Creation. Two derivatives, the Guide (the sage, male basis with the role of guiding and teaching knowledge) and the Guidess (the witch, the temptress, guiding and teaching material knowledge).  -->



<!-- Growing involves acknowledging the Serpent, the cyclical nature of existence (a mother creates a child, the child becomes the mother etc.). Then we either become the serpent (fulfilling and becoming the archetypes) or we battle the serpent (trying to break the cycle, for instance by ...).  -->

<!-- The archetype of the artist? The integration of the feminine creation with the masculine transcendental nature of the object. -->

<!-- Other archetypes (the warrior, the lover...)  -->

<!-- mother est aussi le matériel, le temporel, c'est la nature. hence mother nature as one of the earliest divinity. father est le divin, l'éternel, le transcendant. hence dieux qui a souvent une figure masculine.  -->
