It does not reflect any personal beliefs. This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information. The idea that the mind is deeply structured along common lines has always been fascinating to me. In this document, I will gather and discuss ideas that will help me try to outline and develop a new scientific approach to archetypes. Importantly, this archetypal framework is by essence reductionist, exploring the abstract core features of cognition and essentializing them to concepts of pure abstraction. As such, archetypes do not directly relate to individual psychology, nor to anything tangible. "],
["history-of-archetypism.html", "Chapter 2 History of Archetypism 2.1 Philosophical roots 2.2 Carl Jung (1875 - 1961)", " Chapter 2 History of Archetypism 2.1 Philosophical roots It is common to mention Plato’s Idea as the origin or philosophical basis of the Archetypes. 2.2 Carl Jung (1875 - 1961) Originally named “primordial images” (a term he borrowed from the historian of art Jacob Burckhardt), Jung understood archetypes as universal, archaic patterns or images that derive from the collective unconscious, seen as the psychic counterpart of bodily instincts (Feist and Feist 2009). He makes a distinction between archetypes-as-such, the underlying forms from which emerge motives that he refers to as archetypal images (e.g., the mother, the child, …). These archetypal images are made manifest (i.e., explicit and consciously accessible) as they are filled with specific content through history, culture or personal history (Papadopoulos 2012). In his later life, inspired by oriental philosophies, Jung used the term unus mundus to describe the unitary reality which underlay all manifest phenomena. Jung expanded the notion of archetypes to the physical world itself, suggesting that “psychoid” archetypes (the non-psychic aspect of the archetype), fundamental principles of matter and energy, are the mediators of the unus mundus. Critically, Jung’s archetypes stem out of the collective unconscious, therefore forming a substratum common to all humanity. Interstingly, while the archetypal images (the manifest motives) are usually the main focus of interest, it is important to note that Jung himself warned against such simplification. Such “definite mythological images of motifs […] are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited”. Again, the true archetypes for Jung were their deeper, instinctual, fluid sources – “the ‘archaic remnants’, which I call ‘archetypes’ or ‘primordial images’” (Jung and others 1964). Other authors have attributed 12 different archetypal images to Jung, organized in three overarching categories, based on a fundamental driving force. These include: The Ego Types The Innocent The Orphan The Hero The Caregiver The Soul Types The Explorer The Rebel The Lover The Creator The Self Types The Jester The Sage The Magician The Ruler However, References "],
["a-neurocognitive-perspective.html", "Chapter 3 A Neurocognitive Perspective 3.1 Archtypes as Neurocognitive Invariants 3.2 Neurological Substrate", " Chapter 3 A Neurocognitive Perspective Many archetypes theorists have adopted a bottom-up approach, from Jung itself, exploring various cultures, myths, religions or the depths of Human’s psyche (using tools of pseudo-access such as psychoanalysis or hypnosis). The archetypist’s role was then to assemble and integrate the interpretations that emerged from these observations, in a theory that could be applied to explain these observations. We will take the opposite approach. Based on scientific knowledge about evolution, biology and neuroscience, we will outline a plausible framework, that we will then test on observations. 3.1 Archtypes as Neurocognitive Invariants contrary to Jung, these archetypes are not originating from some collective unconscious, but rather are created and maintained by the ontology of the individual, and patterns are crystilised out of the répétition and similarity accross individual ontologies (e.g., the presnece of a fatherly and a motherly figure, etc.) 3.2 Neurological Substrate Attempts have been made to map archetypes unto brain structures (Samuels 2003). For instance, Rossi (1977) suggested that one could locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere, based on the idea that the left hemisphe would be primarily verbal and associational, and the right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. In light of the current neuroscientific data, these theories appear as nonsensical and naive. That being said, if archetypes are engrammed into the cognitive system, a biological basis has to exist. One potential answer is to reframe archetypism under the predictive coding framework. As such, archetypes could be seen as meta-priors. References "],
