Warning: This is a work in progress, being currently just a collection of unstructured information. The idea that the mind is deeply organized along universal lines has always been fascinating to me. Although strongly criticized and mostly debunked by science, the notion that cognition is structurally clustered in a similar way across time and space has endured, gradually leaving the prison of scientific psychology to pervade other fields, such as history of arts, literature and anthropology. In fact, the notion of archetypes has become quite popular in the recent years, evidence being “found” within the redundancies of Human behaviours, myths and stories of old. In turn, understanding and acknowledging the existence of archetypes is often presented as a step toward personal development, if not mental health. But beyond the scent of pseudo-science that emanates from this concept, do archetypes make any scientific sense? Archetypes, as they are commonly defined and conceptualized (i.e., with a Jungian-based psychodynamic approach), are hardly compatible with the current scientific knowledge. For instance, Jung’s collective unconscious has no place in light of what we know about neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, and functional or structural neuroanatomy. Similarly, research on personality and psychological inter-individual differences does not support the existence of profiles that would resemble commonly described archetypal figures (for example the warrior, the hero or the old man). Nonetheless, I think (and hope), that a scientific approach to archetypism (the study of psychological archetypes) is possible and potentially interesting. Thus, the goal of this book is to provide a new and rational perspective on archetypes, informed by biology, psychology, and neuroscience. My own journey started as a naive interest for psychoanalysis in general, and a particular appeal for the deeply hidden core(s) of our being. But that original appeal did not last very long. The first blow was given by the Black Book of Psychoanalysis (“Le livre noir de la psychanalyse”; Borch-Jacobsen et al. 2005), that superbly and elegantly exposes and deconstructs most of the psychodynamic approach. And yet, my disillusionment was not complete, as Jung’s “Depth Psychology” somehow resisted and maintained some level of magnetism in the back of my mind. Indeed, possibly related to my shared interest for myths and history of religions, or to some other unconscious motivation, I found Jungian mythological and cross-cultural perspective attractive (or, at least, interesting). But as my knowledge grew, I could no longer ignore the evidence… And that evidence is presented on a golden plate in the excellent book titled “Jung et les archétypes. Un mythe contemporain”, in which Le Quellec (2013) casts compelling doubt (if not fire) upon the whole Jungian enterprise. Reading it finally cured from all psychodynamic non-sense. But it left me wondering; what is left of archetypes in this landscape of burning ashes? As a phoenix, can this idea be reborn?

Archetypes, in their “psychological” meaning (as related to the structure of the mind), were originally conceptualised, defined as such, and popularized by Carl Jung in the early 20th century. Thus, a meaningful history of archetypes should start here, with Jung, although deeper and earlier roots and sources of inspiration are often mentioned (for instance, by Jung himself). Regarding these often-cited “ancient roots” of archetypes-related ideas, it is important to note, however, that they usually take the form of posterior re-interpretations done through a Jungian lens (eventually leading to deformations and misinterpretation of the original ideas). Thus, understanding the Jungian approach is a relevant starting point to understand the history and current state of archetypism, its brilliance as well as its limitations. 1.1 Carl Jung (1875 - 1961) The end of romantic era, in the late 19th century, was marked by the after-effects of earlier major discoveries (e.g., electricity), that stirred up a bubbling environment for arts, philosophy and science. It is when neuroscience makes its formal debuts (even though the term “neuroscience” would appear only a century later, in the 1960s; Rose 2015), and when psychology starts its process of independence as a scientific field, both coexisting with pseudo-scientific approaches such as hypnotism or the theory of Orgone. “It was a time when poets consorted with laboratory scientists, when philosophical doctors developed scientific theories, when Alexander Bell could work out his physiological psychology in a series of lectures to London artists, when scientists could perform as showmen, and researcher’s experiments could be replicated by an eager public wherever it was possible.” (Richardson 2001) Our story starts right after, at the dawn of the 20th century. These are turbulent times for psychology, being torn between two opposite movements, one aiming at the pure reduction of mind to a set of laws and rules constrained by biology and physics (behaviourism, psychophysics, Gestalt…), and the other aiming at the reduction of the mind to a set of “extra-biological” entities forming the psyche (psychodynamic approaches, …). It is also a time of political unrest, when identities of nations and people are being challenged in the face of emerging doctrines and globalizing economies. Nationalist views are on the rise in Europe, and supposed lost roots are sought in so-called “primitive” cultures, often fuelled by more-or-less (and sometimes fully esoteric) scientific anthropologic theories (one posterior exemplification being the 1938 nazi expeditions to the Himalayas aimed, among others, to investigate possible origins of the Aryan race). It is in this troubled context that the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung gave to “archetypes” its modern meaning in 1919. Originally named “primordial images” (a term he borrowed from the historian of art Jacob Burckhardt), Jung understood archetypes as universal and archaic patterns, or images, that derive from the collective unconscious, itself seen as the psychic counterpart of bodily instincts (Feist and Feist 2009). He makes a distinction between archetypes-as-such and archetypal images, the former being the underlying forms from which emerge the latter (e.g., the mother, the child, …). These archetypal images are made manifest (i.e., explicit and consciously accessible) as they are filled with specific content through history, culture or personal history (Papadopoulos 2012). Figure 1.1: Carl Jung (1875 - 1961). In his later life, inspired by oriental philosophies, Jung used the term unus mundus to describe the unitary reality which underlay all manifest phenomena. Through it, he expanded the notion of archetypes to the physical world itself, defining “psychoid” archetypes (the non-psychic aspect of the archetype) as fundamental principles of matter and energy, and mediators of the unus mundus. Critically, Jung’s archetypes stem out of the collective unconscious, therefore forming a psychological layer common to all humanity. The collective unconscious is, in Jung’s perspective, referred to as the knowledge and experiences that we share as a species, a reminiscent echo of information passed down through generations from before the dawn of mankind. Figure 1.2: Illustration created by Jung (The Red Book: Liber Novus, 2009). Jung also named “archetypes” what could be seen as parts of the psyche. In particular, he focused on five of such dimensions: The Anima and the Animus are the feminine and masculine aspects of our Psyche. He mentions four distinct levels of development for the feminine Anima, corresponding to its formation and evolution during the lifetime of an individual. Eve is the first stage, where the anima emerges in the shape of the male’s object of desire. She then becomes Helen (of Troy, who sailed away from his husband), an independent and intelligent woman. She achieves virtue in Mary (the purest figure in Christian tradition), and finally becomes Sophia, the incarnation of the idea of divine wisdom. For the Animus, the main features of the four parallel stages of development include physical power (such as “the fictional jungle hero Tarzan”), action and romance (the hero), knowledge (professor or the clergyman), and spiritual wisdom (Hermes, the messenger of the gods). Like Sophia, it is considered the highest level of mediation between the unconscious and conscious mind. It is interesting to note the subtle mirroring of the feminine and masculine stages. While the first stages are both characterized by bodily needs and drives (sexual beauty and physical strength) and then action and commitment, the third stage underlines values of morality for the feminine and knowledge for the masculine, that could be seen as immaterial and material forms of wisdom. Finally, the last stage emphasizes a more spiritual and esoteric aspects of wisdom (Sophia and Hermes being two central figures in alchemy and others esoteric doctrines). The shadow is the part of one’s Self to which the conscious ego does not identify. The Persona refers to the image that a person presents to the world. According to Jung, the Persona is “a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and on the other to conceal the true nature of the individual”. It emerges from the amalgamation of what an individual wants to be, what he thinks he is, what other people think of him and what they want him to be. The Self is the realised product of the integration of all conscious and unconscious aspects of our personality. Interestingly, while the archetypal images (the manifest motives) are usually the main focus and interest of subsequent authors (see below), it is important to note that Jung himself warned against such simplification. Such “definite mythological images of motifs […] are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited”. Again, the true archetypes for Jung were their deeper, instinctual, fluid sources – “the ‘archaic remnants’, which I call ‘archetypes’ or ‘primordial images’” (Jung and others 1964). 1.2 Philosophical roots It is common to mention Plato’s Idea as the origin or philosophical basis for archetypes, mainly because of Carl Jung’s supposed inspiration. Pre-Jungian Usages of the Word: Plato’s idea theory segue into Christian philosophy Descartes (?) 1.3 Archetypal Interpretation of the Tarot Before we dive in into more classical neojungian archetypes, let us take a detour by an object which obscure symbolism has de facto endowed it with esoteric knowledge which access was attempted using archetype-like concepts. The first documented tarot packs were recorded between 1440 and 1450, and are likely to have entered Europe from Egypt in the late 14th century. The Tarot consists of 78 cards - 56 in the Minor Arcana and 22 in the Major Arcana (also known as the trump cards), which consists of the emblematic picture cards of a tarot deck. Although the tarot being a very old game, its interpretation as having a relationship with archetypes was started by Jung himself in 1933. “They are psychological images, symbols with which one plays, as the unconscious seems to play with its contents.” The content on these cards, said Jung, “are sort of archetypal ideas, of a differentiated nature.” Figure 1.3: The 22 cards in the Major Arcana of the ‘Tarot de Marseilles’. The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, numbered in Roman numerals from I to XXI, while The Fool is the only unnumbered card, sometimes placed at the beginning of the deck as 0, or at the end as XXII. I. The Magician The High Priestess The Empress The Emperor V. The Hierophant The Lovers The Chariot Strength The Hermit X. Wheel of Fortune Justice The Hanged Man Death Temperance The Devil The Tower The Star The Moon The Sun Judgement The World The Fool It is understandable that the mysterious origin of the Tarot, its esoteric figures, and critically the symbolic details present in them created a fertile terrain for all kinds of interpretations. Attempts to map these figures to Jungian concepts have been numerous. For instance, the Fool, interpreted as carefree ignorance, has been connected with the unrealised Self. He carries a closed bag, said to contain the tools that could allow him to achieve wholeness. On the other side, the World card (XXI), representing completion and success, has been related to the Self realised, as it shows an individual floating amongst the clouds. His nudity can be interpreted as transparency and revelation, where what was hidden before has now become known. The four animals present in the corners corresponds to the four elements in Christian symbolism, and are interpreted as evidence that the individual has harnessed the four elements present within Nature (being the fifth element). 1.4 Joseph Campbell (1904 - 1987) In “The Hero with a Thousand Faces”, Campbell (1949), inspired by Jung, presents his theory of the mythological structure of the journey of the archetypal hero extracted by comparing myths from different regions of the world. Coined the “Hero’s Journey”, he describes the ultimate narrative archetype as a “monomyth” (a recurring mythological motif). Importantly to our topic of archetypes, he identifies common tropes or characters that take part in this meta-narrative. For instance, the young hero, the wise old man or woman, the goddess, the temptress and the shadowy antagonist, that he relates to archetypes. He suggests that such myths and stories have a narrative structure that mirrors or echoes the psychological structure of the mind, which is the reason of their power. Figure 1.4: Campbell’s (1949) 17 stages of the hero’s journey. 1.5 Robert Moore (1942 - 2016) In “King Warrior Magician Lover”, Moore and Gillette (1991) discuss the four primary masculine archetypes: King Warrior Magician Lover To each one of these archetypes correspond an immature version: The Divine Child The Hero The Precocious Child The Oedipal Child In the same framework, feminine (although not directly mentioned by the original authors) are: Queen Mother Wise woman Lover 1.6 Carol Pearson (1944 - Present) In “The Hero and the Outlaw”, Mark and Pearson (2001) discuss twelve archetypes: The Innocent The Orphan / Everyman The Hero The Caregiver The Explorer The Rebel The Lover The Creator The Jester The Sage The Magician The Ruler Figure 1.5: The 12 archetypes and the specific ‘universal needs’ that they address, grouped by their orientation (ego, order, freedom and social) and type (based on their ‘driving source’): the diagonal archetypes (outline in black) correspond to the Self type, the vertical archetypes (outlined in white) to the Ego type, and the horizontal archetypes (outlined in grey) to the Soul type. This framework has been complexified, grouping these twelve archetypes into sets, for instance by classifying them into three types relative to their “driving source”. For instance, the Ego type (Innocent, Orphan, Hero and Caregiver) is driven to fulfil ego-defined agendas and mutatis mutandis for the Soul (Explorer, Rebel, Lover and Creator) and Self (Jester, Sage, Magician and Ruler) types. Additionally to the type, these archetypes can also be clustered according to their orientation on a two-dimensional plane with four cardinal points, which are Ego (leaving a mark on the world), Order (providing structure), Freedom (yearning for paradise) and Social (connecting to others), creating pairs of opposite (Social and Freedom being opposed to Ego Order, respectively). The type and the orientation are additive groupings. For example, the Caregiver, being of the Ego-type, is driven by the need to fulfil ego agendas, through meeting the needs of others (characterising its social orientation). In a different way, the Hero, also driven by the same need to fulfil ego agendas, does so through courageous action that proves self-worth (characterising its ego orientation). Finally, each of these twelve archetypes is addressing a specific “universal Human need”, namely safety (the Innocent), belonging (the Orphan), mastery (the Hero), service (the Caregiver), freedom (the Explorer), liberation (the Rebel), intimacy (the Lover), innovation (the Creator), pleasure (the Jester), understanding (the Sage), power (the Magician) and control (the Ruler). However, it is important to note that the framework proposed by Mark and Pearson (2001) was initially created with companies in mind rather than individuals per se, to help new business developing their brand by increasing their identification with specific archetypes. This archetypal branding could facilitate, supposedly, directly communicating with the potential client’s unconscious in order to sell more products. This is followed by attempts to attribute dominant archetypes to existing brands. This perspective and usage of archetypes is, in our humble opinion, quite nonsensical in regards with science. Figure 1.6: Examples of association between existing brands and archetypes (retrieved from https://visionone.co.uk/app/uploads/brand-archetype-wheel.png and https://www.retailmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Pic2.png). 1.7 Other Developpments The coach Scott Jeffrey, after disguising random information as facts (e.g., “archetypes influence 99% of human behavior”), ends up with a list of over 325 archetypes (!), suggesting that their number is even larger (“the reality is that there are thousands of archetypes. Each one possesses different behavioral patterns and subtleties”). Besides the uselessness of an infinitely fined-grained concept, these classifications (that the author defines himself as “set patterns of behavior”) are clearly different from archetypes as conceptualised in this book.

Thus, it is unsuprising that one of the main line of critique of archetypes (and also, of comparative mythology), aims at this will to find, and bias in favour of, shared characteristics rather than differences and nuances. Where does a neuroscientific archetypism place itself? As per its name, the assumption that we hold is that archetypes, if they exist, are products of the brain and, by extension, are tied to the structural similarities that we share as Humans. 2.2 From Theory to Application Following Jung’s work, many archetype theorists have adopted a “bottom-up approach”, i.e., starting from observations to infer the cause (the nature of archetypes). Observations are gathered by exploring various cultures, myths, religions or the depths of Human’s psyche (using tools of pseudo-access such as psychoanalysis or hypnosis). In this framework, the archetypist’s role is to assemble and integrate the interpretations emerging from these observations, in a theory that could be applied to explain these observations. In this book, we will take the opposite approach. Based on scientific knowledge about evolution, biology and neuroscience, we will outline a plausible framework, that we will then test on observations and facts. 2.3 A Falsifiable Theory The fundamental issue of psychoanalysis is that it is not a scientific theory, which requires a possibility of falsification. For example, Newton’s law of gravity could easily be falsified if, for instance, the apple did not fall from the tree but levitated there (and it has been later falsified by astronomical observations, and eventually replaced, by Einstein’s set of theories). On the contrary, every observation is evidence in favour of psychoanalysis, and the same can unfortunately be said for Jungian’s approach. This pseudoscientific nature is particularly relevant for the Jungian conceptualisation of archetypes, which suffers from a structural and inherent unscientificalness. In metaphorical terms, we could say that it is an ouroboros (the symbol of a dragon/serpent eating its own tail): the natural “consequences” of archetypes (i.e., the manifest patterns and motifs that we observe in myths, stories, religions…) are also, in theory, the “cause” of them. In other words, the existence of numerous instances of wise old men is brandished as the one of the only possible manifest proof for the existence of the archetype of the wise old man. And the redundancy of this motif is also what perpetuates its archetypal nature. The serpent eats itself, and the existence of this archetype, as it is tied only to a given existing observation, is unfalsifiable. On an abstract level, if B is the cause of C, scientists would investigate the cause(s) and origin(s) of B, let it be A, so that A → B → C. The system has a clear causal structure. For archetypes, the current approach suggests that A &lt;-&gt; B: archetypal images are made manifest (observable, and thus measurable) as they are filled with a idiosyncratic content (depending on the culture, beliefs, personal experience etc.). Hence, we cannot demonstrate that archetypes do not exist, because every motif is potentially a proof in favour of an archetype. Figure 2.1: The oldest evident depictions of an ouroboros to date, appearing on the second gilded shrine of Tutankhamun (14th century BC). Therefore, how to scientifically test (and refute) archetypism is the core question of any scientific approach to archetypism. Thus, after outlining our perspective on archetypes in the following chapters, we will propose practical ways to assess their existence and role in society and individuals. 2.4 Limitations One practical limitation of our approach is that some of the data is already known, which makes it hard to blindly derive predictions from a model that one could later test. For instance, if we postulate that archetypical motives could be present within the similarities of myths, stories and religions, it is hard not to be inspired and influenced by the existing facts. Even with good theoretical reasons, it appears as complicated to postulate the existence of a given archetypal motif if we know in advance that its presence in Human productions is very seldom. Our cultural environment influences its theorization. Although it is also the case in other scientific fields, it might be stronger when it comes to archetypes, as they are particularly deeply connected with cultural manifestations. Another, more fundamental, angle of attack concerns the practical value of over-specific and over-generic archetypes. As we have seen in previous examples, some authors proposed a list of archetypes so vast that their usefulness and relevance as a scientific concept is limited. On the other hand, others authors (including Jung) emphasize quite generic figures, such as “the father” or “the mother”. The issue with this is that the fact that that these figures and concepts are critically important in Human culture cannot be used as a evidence in favour of their archetypicity. Yes, a loving mother and a fearless father are common tropes in Human existence. One could thus wonder about the relevance of creating a whole theory around them. Thus, finding the right level, the sweet spot, between specificity and genericity, appears as an important challenge for our endeveour. "],["definition.html", "Chapter 3 Definition 3.1 What are Archetypes? 3.2 Essentialisation", " Chapter 3 Definition Warning: This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information. 3.1 What are Archetypes? We define archetypes as the product of the essentialisation of the space created by the fundamental axes that structure a cognitive system. These axes create layers of opposed poles that are tied to important concepts for adaptation and survival. For example, one possible axis would give rise to the concepts (the centroids of the spaces created by this axis) of life and death, a distinction arguably critical to Humans. In this example, the process of archetypalisation would essentialise these spaces (or proto-concepts), for instance to features or symbols (e.g., the tree, the heart, the skull). But these examples are not necessarily “true” archetypes. Indeed, compared to other results of essentialisation, true archetypes present some specific characteristics. Their ontogenic origin can be traced to the early stages of development (roughly equivalent to children in Humans). They are usually primitive (or “raw”), in the sense that they require minimal cognitive ability to be created. They are efficient, encapsulating and conveying complex meaning in the most effective form. They are important for adaptation and survival, allowing for the easy integration of important notions. They are meta-stable relative to a given spatio-temporal context, meaning that individuals growing in a similar environment (without necessarily communicating between them) should exhibit similar forms of archetypes (as these are essentialised in relation to the interaction between an individual and its environment). As a consequence, archetypes (in our definition) are not universal and can present variations in their presentations depending on the geographical and temporal context. Nevertheless, the proto-concepts that they are attached to might be similar. For example, the essentialisation of the concept of life and death might manifest under different forms: a society were a given animal is the main cause of death may use it as its symbol, compared to another society in which death is best exemplified through something else. That being said, a society where death does not exist (in which the life and death distinction is useless) might not display any (pseudo)archetype for it. Archetypes are neither collective per se. They do not emanate or emerge from some shared memories or history, other than the similarities of our lives. They are deeply and inherently individual, and their collective aspect (as they are usually shared within a given culture) is merely a reflection of the ontogenic and evolutionary redundancies. 3.2 Essentialisation Essentialisation is the core mechanism underlying the existence and creation of archetypes. Essentialisation is in general achieved either through biomorphism (in particular, anthropomorphism), giving Human or animal-like aspect to objects, or symbolification, reducing a concept to a (usually visual) symbol. The mode of essentialisation might depend on cognitive abilities (abstraction / imagery abilities) and environment (prevalence of natural or abstract objects). archetype primaire (innés) = génétique, adaptive archétype secondaire (activés) = activés par l’expérience precoces (sur un modèle epigenetique) archétype tertiaires (créés) : crée et entrenues par la culture "],["the-main-archetypes.html", "Chapter 4 The Main Archetypes 4.1 Masculine and Feminine 4.2 The Two Worlds 4.3 Known vs. Unknown 4.4 Time 4.5 Moral 4.6 Order 4.7 Death 4.8 The artist 4.9 The Serpent 4.10 Light and Shadow", " Chapter 4 The Main Archetypes Warning: This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information. The main archetypes discussed in this chapter reffered to as “axial archetypes”, as they emerge from to the axes that structure our mental system. As this system grows and complexifies, its dimensionality increases, creating new planes and providing more coordinates to navigate in this space. As a result of the densification of this matrix, archetypes become more subtler, fine-grained and ultimately fading into the unicity that is characterising our identity. Thus, archetypes are usually paired (as they are the two spaces created separated by a line), creating a symmetric and hierarchical structure. Importantly, they can be identified, and grouped, relative to their causing axis, which is often an important distinction that the organism has to learn in order to adapt. Thus, evidence for archetypes can be indirectly gathered by demonstrating the existence and relevance of their axis of reference. 4.1 Masculine and Feminine Existing theories and models often associate archetpyes with specific genders, namely “feminine” and “masculine”. While this will also be the case in the current book, the reader must be aware that we see it mainly as a flexible (and convenient) appelation. In the archetypal framework, the Masculine and Feminine adjectives do not directly refer, nor are limited, to their respective biological genders, but rather to features of the two primordial archetypes, the father and the mother (see below). That does not preclude that a masculine archetype can be embodied by a female figure and vice versa. Moreover, another limitation of this pseudo-sexualised perspective is that it is, to some extent, anthropomorphic or primatomorphic (or at least mammalomorphic). Indeed, in these classes and families, males often endorse the role of protection, fighting for females through which reproduction can be achieved. However, other taxa of animals, with different reproduction systems, might have these roles changed, or reversed. For instance, in ants, the ruler and the warriors are Females, whereas the males are typically exhibiting roles that would be anthropomorphically labeled as feminine. Thus, while we will keep using Masculine and Feminine in their primatal sense, these adjectives may not be universally relevant. 4.2 The Two Worlds The Outside vs. the Inside, or the external and internal worlds (or Self vs. non-Self), is the first axis differenciating our proto-experience. Transcendal vs. Natural. The newborn is a fragile and dependent entity, which safety depends on the Mother and the Father. These are the first Both are vectors of protection. The father protects from the outside world, unknown and dangerous, while the mother protects from internal dangers by fullfilling biological needs (hunger, thirst, affection, …). Common mistake is to consider that only father is protection. mother is a protective figure too, and can be one of the fiercest (e.G., Jessen, 2019). These two primordial archetypes will create the primordial axis, external vs. internal worlds. A secondary axis could be the real vs. the unreal. Figure 4.1: The Primordial Axis. 4.3 Known vs. Unknown Knowledge Knower of beyond vs. knower of within. The child wants to know, and understand this world around and within him. From the Mother, master of nature, stems out the Feminine Knower. From the Father, master of the transcendent, stems out the Masculine Knower. 4.4 Time 4.5 Moral For elderly figures, this is assimilated with the place in the society, whether inside (priest, matron) or outside (hermit and witch). For young figures, this reflects the societal and cultural judgment. The hero and the virgin are pure archetypes of virtue, whereas the wanderer and the whore are usually societal and cultural outcasts. 4.6 Order At one point, the realisation comes that all these figures are subordinated to an overarching ordering and structuring force, the Ruler. Altough this archetype has often been related or embodied by Masculine entities, it does not need to be so, as it highly depends on societal and biologoical factors (related to the culture or Specie concerned). For instance, due to the cultural and political system of the western world (for instance, feodalism), the ruler position was generally connected to some level of physical protection offered (hence the king was usually glorified as a great warrior). society vs outside = order vs chaos 4.7 Death Death is surely a major drive. Death (Order) vs. Life (Chaos) duality? 4.8 The artist The artist is the integration of the feminine creation with the masculine transcendental nature of the object. Located at the centre, it shares aspects and potentialities of other archetypes. For instance, the artist can take uptake the purity, such as Michel-Angelo, or being the outcast, combining features of the hermit, living on the fringes of society, but also with the wanderer (as the rogue traveller and story-teller), as well as the whore () or the witch (). Figure 4.2: The main archetypes and their hierarchical structure. 4.9 The Serpent The serpent represent the cyclical nature of existence. A mother creates a child, the child becomes the mother, and the cycle restarts. Becoming an adult means facing the serpent. Alternative ways can be to embrace (become the serpent (fulfilling the archetypes and becoming the Father or the Mother), or to battle the serpent, by trying to break the cycle. The serpent represents also the Self, always changing, but always the same. Battling the Serpent means casting light onto the external and internal shadows. 4.10 Light and Shadow The stronger the light, the darker the shadow.

For instance, Rossi (1977) suggested that one could locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere, based on the idea that the left hemisphe would be primarily verbal and associational, and the right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. In light of the current neuroscientific data, these theories appear as nonsensical and naive. That being said, if archetypes are engrammed into the cognitive system, a biological basis has to exist. One potential answer is to reframe archetypism under the predictive coding framework. As such, archetypes could be seen as meta-priors.

The historicity of a massive volcanic explosion happening in the Mediteranean is fairly plausible, which is line with the inclusion of this motif in most of the mediteraneean civilizations. The eruption would have been so strong that it would have clouded the sky with ashes all over the planet, creating a sudden drop of temperatures (possibly causing a so-called nuclear winter).

It does not reflect any personal beliefs. Warning: This is a work in progress, being currently just a collection of unstructured information. The idea that the mind is deeply organized along universal lines has always been fascinating to me. Although strongly criticized and mostly debunked by science, the notion that cognition is structurally clustered in a similar way across time and space has endured, gradually leaving the prison of scientific psychology to pervade other fields, such as history of arts, literature and anthropology. In fact, the notion of archetypes has become quite popular in the recent years, evidence being “found” within the redundancies of Human behaviours, myths and stories of old. In turn, understanding and acknowledging the existence of archetypes is often presented as a step toward personal development, if not mental health. But beyond the scent of pseudo-science that emanates from this concept, do archetypes make any scientific sense? Archetypes, as they are commonly defined and conceptualized (i.e., with a Jungian-based psychodynamic approach), are hardly compatible with the current scientific knowledge. For instance, Jung’s collective unconscious has no place in light of what we know about neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, and functional or structural neuroanatomy. Similarly, research on personality and psychological inter-individual differences does not support the existence of profiles that would resemble commonly described archetypal figures (for example the warrior, the hero or the old man). Nonetheless, I think (and hope), that a scientific approach to archetypism (the study of psychological archetypes) is possible and potentially interesting. Thus, the goal of this book is to provide a new and rational perspective on archetypes, informed by biology, psychology, and neuroscience. My own journey started as a naive interest for psychoanalysis in general, and a particular appeal for the deeply hidden core(s) of our being. But that original appeal did not last very long. The first blow was given by the Black Book of Psychoanalysis (“Le livre noir de la psychanalyse”; Borch-Jacobsen et al. 2005), that superbly and elegantly exposes and deconstructs most of the psychodynamic approach. And yet, my disillusionment was not complete, as Jung’s “Depth Psychology” somehow resisted and maintained some level of magnetism in the back of my mind. Indeed, possibly related to my shared interest for myths and history of religions, or to some other unconscious motivation, I found Jungian mythological and cross-cultural perspective attractive (or, at least, interesting). But as my knowledge grew, I could no longer ignore the evidence… And that evidence is presented on a golden plate in the excellent book titled “Jung et les archétypes. Un mythe contemporain”, in which Le Quellec (2013) casts compelling doubt (if not fire) upon the whole Jungian enterprise. Reading it finally cured from all psychodynamic non-sense. But it left me wondering; what is left of archetypes in this landscape of burning ashes? As a phoenix, can this idea be reborn?
