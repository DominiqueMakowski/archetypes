The idea that the mind is deeply organized along universal lines has always been fascinating to me. Although strongly criticized and mostly debunked by science, the notion that cognition is structurally clustered in a similar way across time and space has endured, gradually leaving the prison of scientific psychology to pervade other fields, such as history of arts, literature and anthropology. In fact, the notion of archetypes has become quite popular in the recent years, evidence being ``found'' within the redundancies of Human behaviours, myths and stories of old. In turn, understanding and acknowledging the existence of archetypes is often presented as a step toward personal development, if not mental health.

\textbf{But beyond the scent of pseudo-science that emanates from this concept, do archetypes make any scientific sense?}

Archetypes, as they are commonly defined and conceptualized (i.e., anchored within a Jungian psychodynamic approach), are hardly compatible with the current scientific knowledge. For instance, Jung's collective unconscious has no place in light of what we know about neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, and functional or structural neuroanatomy. Similarly, research on personality and psychological inter-individual differences does not support the existence of profiles that would resemble commonly described archetypal figures (for example the warrior, the hero or the old man). Nonetheless, I think (and hope), that a scientific approach to archetypism (the study of psychological archetypes) is possible and potentially interesting. Thus, the goal of this book is to provide a new and rational perspective on archetypes, informed by biology, psychology, and neuroscience.

My own journey started even before entering university, as a naive interest for psychoanalysis in general, and a particular appeal for the deeply hidden core(s) of our being. But that original appeal did not last very long. The first blow was given by the \emph{Black Book of Psychoanalysis} \citep[``Le livre noir de la psychanalyse'';][]{borch2005livre}, that superbly and elegantly exposes and deconstructs most of the psychodynamic approach. And yet, my disillusionment was not complete, as Jung's ``Depth Psychology'' somehow resisted and maintained some level of magnetism in the back of my mind. Indeed, possibly related to my shared interest for myths and history of religions, or to some other unconscious motivation, I found Jungian mythological and cross-cultural perspective attractive (or, at least, interesting). But as my knowledge grew, I could no longer ignore the evidence\ldots{} And that evidence is presented on a golden plate in the excellent book titled ``Jung et les archétypes. Un mythe contemporain'', in which \citet{lequellec2013jung} casts compelling doubt (if not fire) upon the whole Jungian enterprise. Reading it finally cured from all psychodynamic non-sense. But it left me wondering; what is left of archetypes in this landscape of burning ashes?

\textbf{As a phoenix, can this idea be reborn?}

This book is first attempt to connect the notion of archetypes with scientific evidence. In the following chapters, I will start by a brief overview of the current landscape of archetypism, as it is found in self-help books and posts. Interestingly, the scientific literature on the topic is scare, if not inexistent. Thus, in the second part, I will try to bridge the concept of archetypes with existing concepts and theories in modern psychology and neuroscience. Finally, based in an evolutionary perspective, I will outline a new definition of archetypes and will suggest some ideas related to a plausible conceptualisation of archetypes. I will conclude by discussing the limitations for the scientific investigation of archetypes (related for instance to the bidirectional causality of its genesis) and future directions.

Until now, we tred presenting the different views and claims neutrally. However,

One major stream of critiques is directed at Jung himself, for his alleged ethnocentrism, racism, colonial mindset, and sympathies for the Nazi regime (see this REFERENCE for an overview of the critiques). But what is more relevant for the topic at hand are the issues pertaining to his developpment of the concept of archetypes.

Circular reasoning.

\hypertarget{future-directions}{%
\subsection{Future Directions}\label{future-directions}}

The psychologist James Hillman suggested to eliminate the noun archetype altogether, while preserving the adjective \emph{archetypal}.

Another possibility is to try to redefine archetypes precisely, and redefine them in a way that makes compatible with scientific investigation and useful for theory or practice (as archetypes are one of the tools used in psychoanalytical therapy). This is the aim of the next chapter.

\hypertarget{what-are-archetypes}{%
\section{What are Archetypes?}\label{what-are-archetypes}}

We define archetypes as the product of the essentialisation of the space created by the fundamental axes that structure a cognitive system. These axes create layers of opposed poles that are tied to important concepts for adaptation and survival. For example, one possible axis would give rise to the concepts (the centroids of the spaces created by this axis) of life and death, a distinction arguably critical to Humans. In this example, the process of archetypalisation would essentialise these spaces (or proto-concepts), for instance to features or symbols (e.g., the tree, the heart, the skull).

But these examples are not necessarily ``true'' archetypes. Indeed, compared to other results of essentialisation, true archetypes present some specific characteristics. Their ontogenic origin can be traced to the early stages of development (roughly equivalent to children in Humans). They are usually primitive (or ``raw''), in the sense that they require minimal cognitive ability to be created. They are efficient, encapsulating and conveying complex meaning in the most effective form. They are important for adaptation and survival, allowing for the easy integration of important notions. They are meta-stable relative to a given spatio-temporal context, meaning that individuals growing in a similar environment (without necessarily communicating between them) should exhibit similar forms of archetypes (as these are essentialised in relation to the interaction between an individual and its environment).

As a consequence, archetypes (in our definition) are not universal and can present variations in their presentations depending on the geographical and temporal context. Nevertheless, the proto-concepts that they are attached to might be similar. For example, the essentialisation of the concept of life and death might manifest under different forms: a society were a given animal is the main cause of death may use it as its symbol, compared to another society in which death is best exemplified through something else. That being said, a society where death does not exist (in which the life and death distinction is useless) might not display any (pseudo)archetype for it.

Archetypes are neither collective \emph{per se}. They do not emanate or emerge from some shared memories or history, other than the similarities of our lives. They are deeply and inherently individual, and their collective aspect (as they are usually shared within a given culture) is merely a reflection of the ontogenic and evolutionary redundancies.

\hypertarget{essentialisation}{%
\section{Essentialisation}\label{essentialisation}}

Essentialisation is the core mechanism underlying the existence and creation of archetypes. Essentialisation is in general achieved either through biomorphism (in particular, anthropomorphism), giving Human or animal-like aspect to objects, or symbolification, reducing a concept to a (usually visual) symbol. The mode of essentialisation might depend on cognitive abilities (abstraction / imagery abilities) and environment (prevalence of natural or abstract objects).

The archetypal framework developped in this book is by essence reductionist, exploring the abstract core features of cognition and essentializing them to concepts of pure abstraction. As such, archetypes do not directly relate to individual psychology, nor to anything tangible.

One could define an archetype is a basic frame facilitating a basic, instinctive, and intuitive understanding of a concept or a personality. This definition brings it close to a key concept in psychology, heuristics.

Archetypes are a tangible reflection of a neuropsychological proto-structure. But do they have a biological existence?

\hypertarget{origin}{%
\section{Origin}\label{origin}}

Are the archetypes innate? No, (altough they might have been favoured by evolution); they stem out of the redunduncies of existence.

\hypertarget{archetypes-as-neurocognitive-invariants}{%
\section{Archetypes as Neurocognitive Invariants}\label{archetypes-as-neurocognitive-invariants}}

contrary to Jung, these archetypes are not originating from some collective unconscious, but rather are created and maintained by the ontology of the individual, and patterns are crystilised out of the répétition and similarity accross individual ontologies (e.g., the presnece of a fatherly and a motherly figure, etc.)

\hypertarget{neurological-substrate}{%
\section{Neurological Substrate}\label{neurological-substrate}}

Attempts have been made to map archetypes unto brain structures \citep{samuels2003jung}. For instance, \citet{rossi1977cerebral} suggested that one could locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere, based on the idea that the left hemisphe would be primarily verbal and associational, and the right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. In light of the current neuroscientific data, these theories appear as nonsensical and naive.

That being said, if archetypes are engrammed into the cognitive system, a biological basis has to exist. One potential answer is to reframe archetypism under the predictive coding framework. As such, archetypes could be seen as meta-priors.
