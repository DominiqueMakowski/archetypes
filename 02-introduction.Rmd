# A Scientific Archetypism

**Warning: This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information.**



Many archetype theorists have adopted a bottom-up approach, from Jung itself, exploring various cultures, myths, religions or the depths of Human's psyche (using tools of pseudo-access such as psychoanalysis or hypnosis). The archetypist's role was then to assemble and integrate the interpretations that emerged from these observations, in a theory that could be applied to explain these observations.

We will take the opposite approach. Based on scientific knowledge about evolution, biology and neuroscience, we will outline a plausible framework, that we will then test on observations.

<!-- *archetypism* (the science of archetypes).  -->
<!-- The goal of the archetypist is to study these and uncover their role in society or individuals -->


One of the main angle of attacks could be the practical value of generic archetype. Yes, a loving mother and a fearless father are common tropes in Human existence. What is the point of creating a whole pseudo-theory around them? A collateral question would be, do they (as concepts) have any direct influence over our lives?
