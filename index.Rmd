# Introduction

*Disclaimer: This is a compilation of thoughts that might be some day used in a future fictional novel. **It does not reflect any personal beliefs.***

**This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information**.

The idea that the mind is deeply structured along common lines has always been fascinating to me. In this document, I will gather and discuss ideas that will help me *try to* outline and develop a new scientific approach to archetypes. Importantly, this archetypal framework is by essence reductionist, exploring the abstract core features of cognition and essentializing them to concepts of pure abstraction. As such, archetypes do not directly relate to individual psychology, nor to anything tangible.
