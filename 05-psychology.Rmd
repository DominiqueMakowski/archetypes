# Archetypes and Psychology

***Warning:* This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information.**

The archetypal framework developped in this book is by essence reductionist, exploring the abstract core features of cognition and essentializing them to concepts of pure abstraction. As such, archetypes do not directly relate to individual psychology, nor to anything tangible.


## Archetypes as the Self

The serpent is as the Self. Always changing, but always the same.



## Archetypes as Personality Clusters


## Archetypes as Heuristics

A more process-based and fluid framework.

One could define an archetype is a basic frame facilitating a basic, instinctive, and intuitive understanding of a concept or a personality. This definition brings it close to a key concept in psychology, heuristics.
