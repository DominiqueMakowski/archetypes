<!-- Litterature about personification bias -->



<!-- In his book Born Believers, Barrett presents evidence for the following claims: (i) From infancy, people easily differentiate agents from other objectsand understand well how they behave; (ii) children and adults fluently attribute agency and mentality even to objects that do not resemble humans (e.g., geometric figures moving non-randomly); (iii) agents need not be visible to be very real (e.g., over 40 percent of children have imaginary friends); (iv) young children attribute superpowers and super-knowledge to agents such as human adults; (v) people have an inclination to search for "hidden" agents in their environment;(vi) people are prone to postulate non-human agency and intention behind the natural world and its objects as well as certain attention-grabbing events (e.g.,natural events such as thunderstorms and shooting stars).
