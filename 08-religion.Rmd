# The Origin of Religions

**Warning: This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information.**


It is possible that archetypes have been deified, mother (nature and creation), father (protection and sky - the unreachable world). 

Archetypes might have been integrated with a will to explain terryfing or unknown phenomena, such as storm, rain, fire, day-night cycle etc.
