The idea that the mind is deeply structured along universal lines has always been fascinating to me. Although strongly criticized and mostly debunked by science, the idea that the mind was structurally clustered in a similar way across the time and space has endured, quitting the prison of scientific psychology to pervade other fields, such as history of arts, literature and anthropology. In fact, the notion of archetypes and archetypal patterns has become quite popular, evidence being "found" within the redundancies of Human behaviours, myths and stories of old.

**But beyond the scent of pseudoscience that emanates from this concept, do archetypes make any scientific sense?** 

Archetypes as they are commonly defined and conceptualized are hardly compatible with the current scientific knowledge. For instance, Jung's collective unconscious has no place in light of what we know about neurogenesis, neurodevelopment and functional and structural neuroanatomy. Similarly, research on personality does not support the existence of clusters, or profiles, that would resemble commonly described archetypal figures (such as the warrior, the hero, etc.). Nonetheless, I think (and hope), that a scientific approach is possible and potentially interesting. Thus, the goal of this book is to provide a new and rational perspective on archetypes, informed by biology, psychology and neuroscience.
