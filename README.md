# Uncovering the Neurocognitive Archetypes

The idea that the mind is deeply structured along universal lines has always been fascinating to me. Although strongly criticized, or simply debunked by science (along with the rest of Jungian psychology), the idea that the mind was structurally clustered in a similar way across the time and space has endured, quitting the prison of scientific psychology to pervade other fields such as history of arts, literature and anthropology. In fact, the notion of archetypes and archetypal patterns has never been so popular, evidence being "found" within the redundancies of Human behaviours, myths and stories of old.

But beyond the smell of pseudoscience that emanates from this concept, do archetypes make any scientific sense? The goal of this book is to provide a new and rational perspective on archetypes, informed by biology, psychology and neuroscience.
