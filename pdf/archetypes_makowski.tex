The idea that the mind is deeply organized along universal lines has always been fascinating to me. Although strongly criticized and mostly debunked by science, the notion that cognition is structurally clustered in a similar way across time and space has endured, gradually leaving the prison of scientific psychology to pervade other fields, such as history of arts, literature and anthropology. In fact, the notion of archetypes has become quite popular in the recent years, evidence being ``found'' within the redundancies of Human behaviours, myths and stories of old. In turn, understanding and acknowledging the existence of archetypes is often presented as a step toward personal development, if not mental health.

\textbf{But beyond the scent of pseudo-science that emanates from this concept, do archetypes make any scientific sense?}

Archetypes, as they are commonly defined and conceptualized (i.e., anchored within a Jungian psychodynamic approach), are hardly compatible with the current scientific knowledge. For instance, Jung's collective unconscious has no place in light of what we know about neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, and functional or structural neuroanatomy. Similarly, research on personality and psychological inter-individual differences does not support the existence of profiles that would resemble commonly described archetypal figures (for example the warrior, the hero or the old man). Nonetheless, I think (and hope), that a scientific approach to archetypism (the study of psychological archetypes) is possible and potentially interesting. Thus, the goal of this book is to provide a new and rational perspective on archetypes, informed by biology, psychology, and neuroscience.

My own journey started even before entering university, as a naive interest for psychoanalysis in general, and a particular appeal for the deeply hidden core(s) of our being. But that original appeal did not last very long. The first blow was given by the \emph{Black Book of Psychoanalysis} \citep[``Le livre noir de la psychanalyse'';][]{borch2005livre}, that superbly and elegantly exposes and deconstructs most of the psychodynamic approach. And yet, my disillusionment was not complete, as Jung's ``Depth Psychology'' somehow resisted and maintained some level of magnetism in the back of my mind. Indeed, possibly related to my shared interest for myths and history of religions, or to some other unconscious motivation, I found Jungian mythological and cross-cultural perspective attractive (or, at least, interesting). But as my knowledge grew, I could no longer ignore the evidence\ldots{} And that evidence is presented on a golden plate in the excellent book titled ``Jung et les arch√©types. Un mythe contemporain'', in which \citet{lequellec2013jung} casts compelling doubt (if not fire) upon the whole Jungian enterprise. Reading it finally cured from all psychodynamic non-sense. But it left me wondering; what is left of archetypes in this landscape of burning ashes?

\textbf{As a phoenix, can this idea be reborn?}

This book is first attempt to connect the notion of archetypes with scientific evidence. In the following chapters, I will start by a brief overview of the current landscape of archetypism, as it is found in self-help books and posts. Interestingly, the scientific literature on the topic is scare, if not inexistent. Thus, in the second part, I will try to bridge the concept of archetypes with existing concepts and theories in modern psychology and neuroscience. Finally, based in an evolutionary perspective, I will outline a new definition of archetypes and will suggest some ideas related to a plausible conceptualisation of archetypes. I will conclude by discussing the limitations for the scientific investigation of archetypes (related for instance to the bidirectional causality of its genesis) and future directions.

\chapter{History of Archetypes}\label{history-of-archetypes}}

\textbf{\emph{Warning:} This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information.}

Archetypes, in their ``psychological'' meaning (as related to the structure of the mind), were originally conceptualised, defined as such, and popularized by Carl Jung in the early 20th century. Thus, a meaningful history of archetypes should start with Jung, although deeper and earlier roots and sources of inspiration are often mentioned (for instance, by Jung himself). Regarding these often-cited ``ancient roots'' of archetypes-related ideas, it is important to note, however, that they usually take the form of posterior re-interpretations done through a Jungian lens (eventually leading to deformations and misinterpretation of the original ideas). Thus, understanding the Jungian approach is a relevant starting point to understand the history and current state of archetypism, its brilliance as well as its limitations. As we will try presenting the different views and claims neutrally, the reader should keep in mind that many of the assertions have not been scientifically validated.

\subsection{Historical context}\label{historical-context}}

The end of romantic era, in the late 19th century, was marked by the after-effects of the industrial revolutions and their major discoveries (e.g., electricity), that stirred up a bubbling environment for arts, philosophy and science. It is for instance when neuroscience makes its formal \emph{debuts} \citep[even though the term ``neuroscience'' would appear only a century later, in the 1960s;][]{rose20155o}, and when psychology starts its process of independence as a scientific field, coexisting (and co-thriving) with pseudo-scientific approaches and ideas such as hypnotism, vitalism, magnetism, odology or the theory of Orgone.

\begin{quote}
``It was a time when poets consorted with laboratory scientists,
when philosophical doctors developed scientific theories,
when Alexander Bell could work out his physiological psychology in a series of lectures to London artists,
when scientists could perform as showmen,
and researcher's experiments could be replicated by an eager public wherever it was possible.'' \citep{richardson2001british}
\end{quote}

Our story starts at the dawn of the 20th century. These are turbulent times for psychology, being torn between two opposite movements, one aiming at the pure reduction of mind to a set of laws and rules constrained by biology and physics (behaviourism, psychophysics, Gestalt\ldots), and the other aiming at the reduction of the mind to a set of ``para-biological'' entities (i.e., which link with biological mechanisms is vague or deemed irrelevant) forming the \emph{psyche} (psychodynamic approaches, \ldots).

It is also a time of political unrest, when identities of nations and people are being challenged in the face of emerging doctrines and globalizing economies. Nationalist views are on the rise in Europe, and supposed lost roots are sought in so-called ``primitive'' cultures, often fuelled by more-or-less scientific (and sometimes fully esoteric) anthropologic theories (such as Blavatsky's Theosophy). This led for instance to the 1938 nazi expeditions to the Himalayas aimed, among others, to investigate possible origins of the Aryan race.

In summary, although not named nor formally defined as a psychological concept, the idea of archetypes, as well as some form of phylogenetic or racial unconscious was common in the intellectual circles around 1900 \citep{shamdasani2003cult}.

\hypertarget{the-collective-unconscious}{%
\subsection{The Collective Unconscious}\label{the-collective-unconscious}}

It is in this troubled context that the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung gave to ``archetypes'' its modern usage in 1919. This concept will be come one of the most important of psychoanalysis \citep{roesler2012archetypes}, marking the split with the Freudian approach and what will become Jung's independent stream of so-called ``depth psychology''. Indeed, archetypes are inextricably linked to the key concept of Jungian psychology, namely the collective (called first ``phylogenetic'') unconscious.

The Jungian simplified conceptualisation of the mind is often presented as a sphere \citep{cann1986jungian}. Below the surface of consciousness lies the \emph{personal} unconscious (consisting of forgotten information, subliminal perceptions, and other elements that are incompatible with one's conscious attitude). At the core of this sphere lies the \emph{collective} unconscious, shared by all humans, filled with instincts, and archetypes.

\hypertarget{jungs-definitions}{%
\subsection{Jung's Definition(s)}\label{jungs-definitions}}

What exactly are archetypes? Interestingly, we do not find a consistent specific definition of archetypes formulated by Jung. Originally named ``primordial images'' (a term he borrowed from the historian of art Jacob Burckhardt), Jung understood archetypes as universal and archaic patterns, or images, that derive from the collective unconscious, itself seen as the psychic counterpart of bodily instincts \citep{feist2009theories}. These archetypes are supposedly responsible for the innate tendency to experience the world in a certain way. They are ``universal patterns producing meaning and guiding development'' \citep{roesler2012archetypes}.

Jung makes a distinction between archetypes \emph{per se} and archetypal images (even though Jungians and Jung himself have often failed to maintain it consistently). Archetypes are forms without content, inaccessible and unrepresentable structures from which emerge archetypical images. The archetypes being themselves contentless, they are often named on the basis of the images whose form they provide. It is common to find specific archetypes named after mythological figures (e.g., the ``Hera'' archetype), anthropological roles (e.g., the ``Mother''), narrative motifs (e.g., ``Wise Old Man'') or some more abstract themes, such as the archetype of engulfment or the archetype of rebirth. These archetypal images are made \emph{manifest} (i.e., explicit and consciously accessible) as they are filled with specific content through history, culture or personal history \citep{papadopoulos2012}, and can be distinguished from ordinary images based on the subjective impression they make on us: they are salient and emotionally loaded, and appear as deep, mysterious and numinous (i.e., with a spiritual, or awe-inspiring, quality). However, adding to the difficulty is the fact that there appears to be no one-to-one relationship between one archetype and an image. Many images can stem out from the same archetype, and a single image could result from the combination of several archetypes at once.

Jung arrived at an idea of archetypes after realizing the large number of participants presenting similar ``complexes'' (i.e., partially repressed, yet highly influential emotional cluster of charged psychic material such as thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, that organises experience, perception, and affect around a central theme). This led Jung to assume the existence of a prototypical pattern behind these similar complexes that would be shared by all human beings. Another stream of evidence came as from Jung's experience with psychotic patients in the Burgh√∂lzli hospital in Zurich, where he saw in many of the patients' ``fantasies'' motifs from ancient mythology. The most famous case being the so-called \emph{Solar Phallus Man}, a patient suffering from paranoid dementia, who reported in 1901 (note that Jung kept changing the dates of this story, as well as hiding the fact that this man was the patient of another psychiatrist) a striking hallucination in which the sun had an upright tail (\emph{``similar to an erect penis,''}, Jung added), which moved back and forth, causing the wind to blow. It is only years later, as Jung became aware of a similar symbol in a recently translated Hellenistic text (The ``Mithras Liturgy'', part of the \emph{Greek Magical Papyri}), which describes a wind originating from a pipe or tube hanging downright from the disc of the sun. Jung assumed that these two symbols were the same, and since the patient was unlikely to be familiar with this text \citep[or so claimed Jung; see][ for a detailed description of Jung's falsifications and lies]{noll1997jung}, its the only possible origin was the collective unconscious.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Carl Jung (1875 - 1961).}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-6}
\end{figure}

In his later life, inspired by oriental philosophies, Jung used the term \emph{unus mundus} to describe the unitary reality which underlay all manifest phenomena. Through it, he expanded the notion of archetypes to the physical world itself, defining ``psychoid'' archetypes (the non-psychic aspect of the archetype) as fundamental principles of matter and energy, and mediators of the \emph{unus mundus}.

\hypertarget{universality}{%
\subsection{Universality}\label{universality}}

Universality is the central feature of Jungian archetypes.

It is these same archetypal images that appear as motifs in myths, legends, fairy tales, literature, and art all around the world, arising from the same set of archetypes present in the collective unconscious.

Note that the collective unconscious and its archetypes are entirely innacessible to our conscious experience. Jung's collective unconscious is just as unknowable as the Kantian \emph{thing-in-itself}.

Critically, Jung's archetypes stem out of the \emph{collective unconscious}, therefore forming a psychological layer common to all humanity. The collective unconscious is, in Jung's perspective, referred to as the knowledge and experiences that we share as a species, a reminiscent echo of information passed down through generations from before the dawn of mankind.

\hypertarget{supposed-manifestations-of-archetypes}{%
\subsection{Supposed Manifestations of Archetypes}\label{supposed-manifestations-of-archetypes}}

A large part of Jungian's model is rooted in the analysis of dreams. The (still lasting) popularity of his approach could be related to its imcreased straightforwardness, as compared to Freudian's more convoluted interpretation framework. Contrary to the latter, Jung believed that the meaning of a dream was directly present in the manifest content of the dream (i.e., what the dreamer experiences).

Jung distinguished two types of dreams: the archetypal and the everyday \citep{cann1986jungian}. Everyday dreams find their origin in the personal unconscious and are related to personal matters. Archetypal dreams, on the opposite, originate from the collective unconscious, and deal with universal themes. The best criterion for distinguishing archetypal dreams appears to be their lack of ``everydayness'' \citep{kluger1975archetypal, cann1986jungian}.

Jung classified personality types by using three pairs of opposites: \emph{introversion} (directing interest and attention towards internal experiences and processes. ) - \emph{extraversion} (directing interest and attention towards people and things in the external world), \emph{sensation} (perceiving the presence and qualities of facts directly through the senses) - \emph{intuition} (perceiving the relations in events and situations unconsciously), and \emph{thinking} (organizing and judging experience on the basis of analysis and logic) - \emph{feeling} (organizing and judging experience on the basis of importance, values, likes, and dislikes).

This model of personality is somewhat not too distant from modern accounts (such as the Big Five and its successors), especially regarding the introversion-extraversion axis. However, a distinction is to be made, as Jung's model does not incorporate one of the other personality dimension, namely \emph{neurosis} (i.e., emotional instability), as such. Instead, Jung conceptualises neurosis as the opposite of psychosis, both related to the pattern relationship between the conscious and the unconscious. In summary, people with neurosis would be out of contact with the collective unconscious, whereas people with psychosis are too much in contact with it, at the expense of external reality (hence the strong interest of Jung for patients suffering from schizophrenia). Additionally, contrary to more recent models in which personality dimensions are conceptualised as to a large extent indepedendent (i.e., all combinations of personality traits are possible), the expression of Jungian's neurosis depends on other dimensions. For instance, the typical form of neurosis for people with high introverion is anxiety, and hysteria (characterized by high activity levels, physical complaints, and emotional volatility) for extroverts.

Importantly for our topic, archetypes have not been directly connected with any personality profiles. Instead, Jung and his followers attempted to use their own conceptualisation of personality profiles (i.e., and of their configuration regarding the relationship between the conscious and the unconscious) to gather evidence in favour of their theory. For instance, by showing that people with high intuitiveness and low neuroticism recall more archetypal dreams \citep[i.e., dreams with less ``everydayness'';][]{kluger1975archetypal, cann1986jungian}.

\hypertarget{archetypes-as-parts-of-the-psyche}{%
\subsection{Archetypes as Parts of the Psyche}\label{archetypes-as-parts-of-the-psyche}}

Jung also named ``archetypes'' what could be seen as parts of the psyche. In particular, he focused on five of such dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{Anima} and the \textbf{Animus} are the feminine and masculine aspects of our Psyche. He mentions four distinct levels of development for the feminine Anima, corresponding to its formation and evolution during the lifetime of an individual. \emph{Eve} is the first stage, where the anima emerges in the shape of the male's object of desire. She then becomes \emph{Helen} (of Troy, who sailed away from his husband), an independent and intelligent woman. She achieves virtue in \emph{Mary} (the purest figure in Christian tradition), and finally becomes \emph{Sophia}, the incarnation of the idea of divine wisdom. For the Animus, the main features of the four parallel stages of development include physical power (such as ``the fictional jungle hero \emph{Tarzan}''), action and romance (the \emph{hero}), knowledge (professor or the clergyman), and spiritual wisdom (\emph{Hermes}, the messenger of the gods). Like Sophia, it is considered the highest level of mediation between the unconscious and conscious mind. It is interesting to note the subtle mirroring of the feminine and masculine stages. While the first stages are both characterized by bodily needs and drives (sexual beauty and physical strength) and then action and commitment, the third stage underlines values of morality for the feminine and knowledge for the masculine, that could be seen as immaterial and material forms of wisdom. Finally, the last stage emphasizes a more spiritual and esoteric aspects of wisdom (Sophia and Hermes being two central figures in alchemy and others esoteric doctrines).
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{shadow} is the part of one's Self to which the conscious ego does not identify.
\item
  The \textbf{Persona} refers to the image that a person presents to the world. According to Jung, the Persona is ``a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and on the other to conceal the true nature of the individual''. It emerges from the amalgamation of what an individual wants to be, what he thinks he is, what other people think of him and what they want him to be.
\item
  The \textbf{Self} is the realised product of the integration of all conscious and unconscious aspects of our personality.
\end{itemize}

Interestingly, while the archetypal images (the manifest motives) are usually the main focus and interest of subsequent authors (see below), it is important to note that Jung himself warned against such simplification. Such \emph{``definite mythological images of motifs {[}\ldots{]} are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited''}. Again, the true archetypes for Jung were their deeper, instinctual, fluid sources -- \emph{``the `archaic remnants', which I call `archetypes' or `primordial images'\,''} \citep{jung1964approaching}.

\hypertarget{archetypes-and-biology}{%
\subsection{Archetypes and Biology}\label{archetypes-and-biology}}

Interestingly, Jung, similarly to Freud, always made great efforts to portray his concepts as rooted in biology (after all, both were physicians by training), for instance in the case of archetypes, via supposed mechanisms of biological inheritance \citep[which is no longer supported by modern genetics modern genetics;][]{roesler2012archetypes}. However, the most notable advances in that area were done by their followers, trying to adapt and accommodate psychodynamic concepts with discovers made in neuroscience and modern psychology.

\hypertarget{philosophical-roots}{%
\subsection{Philosophical roots}\label{philosophical-roots}}

It is common to mention Plato's Idea as the origin or philosophical basis for archetypes, mainly because of Carl Jung's supposed inspiration.

\hypertarget{archetypal-interpretation-of-the-tarot}{%
\subsection{Archetypal Interpretation of the Tarot}\label{archetypal-interpretation-of-the-tarot}}

Before we dive in into more classical neojungian archetypes, let us make a \emph{detour} by an object which obscure symbolism has \emph{de facto} endowed it with esoteric knowledge which access was attempted using archetype-like concepts.

The first documented tarot packs were recorded between 1440 and 1450, and are likely to have entered Europe from Egypt in the late 14th century. The Tarot consists of 78 cards - 56 in the \emph{Minor Arcana} and 22 in the \emph{Major Arcana} (also known as the trump cards), which consists of the emblematic picture cards of a tarot deck. Although the tarot being a very old game, its interpretation as having a relationship with archetypes was started by Jung himself in \href{https://marykgreer.com/2008/03/31/carl-jung-and-tarot/}{1933}. ``They are psychological images, symbols with which one plays, as the unconscious seems to play with its contents.'' The content on these cards, said Jung, ``are sort of archetypal ideas, of a differentiated nature.''

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/tarot} 

}

\caption{The 22 cards in the Major Arcana of the 'Tarot de Marseilles'.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-8}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Major Arcana} consists of 22 cards, numbered in Roman numerals from I to XXI, while The Fool is the only unnumbered card, sometimes placed at the beginning of the deck as 0, or at the end as XXII. They represent, respectively, \emph{The Magician} (I), \emph{The High Priestess} II(), \emph{The Empress} (III), \emph{The Emperor} (IIII), \emph{The Hierophant} (V), \emph{The Lovers} (VI), \emph{The Chariot} (VII), \emph{Strength} (VIII), \emph{The Hermit} (VIIII), \emph{Wheel of Fortune} (X), \emph{Justice} (XI), \emph{The Hanged Man} (XII), \emph{Death} (XIII), \emph{Temperance} (XIIII), \emph{The Devil} (XV), \emph{The Tower} (XVI), \emph{The Star} (XVII), \emph{The Moon} (XVIII), \emph{The Sun} (XVIIII), \emph{Judgement} (XX), \emph{The World} (XXI) and \emph{The Fool} (XXII).

It is understandable that the mysterious origin of the Tarot, its esoteric figures, and critically the symbolic details present in them created a fertile terrain for all kinds of interpretations. Attempts to map these figures to Jungian concepts have been numerous. For instance, the Fool, interpreted as carefree ignorance, has been connected with the unrealised Self. He carries a closed bag, said to contain the tools that could allow him to achieve wholeness. On the other side, the World card (XXI), representing completion and success, has been related to the Self realised, as it shows an individual floating amongst the clouds. His nudity can be interpreted as transparency and revelation, where what was hidden before has now become known. The four animals present in the corners corresponds to the four elements in Christian symbolism, and are interpreted as evidence that the individual has harnessed the four elements present within Nature (being the fifth element).

\begin{quote}
\emph{Dreams are private myths, and myths are public dreams.}

\hfill --- Joseph Campbell
\end{quote}

In ``The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', \citet{campbell1949hero}, inspired by Jung, presents his theory of the mythological structure of the journey of the archetypal hero extracted by comparing myths from different regions of the world. Coined the ``Hero's Journey'', he describes the ultimate narrative archetype as a ``monomyth'' (a recurring mythological motif).

Importantly to our topic of archetypes, he identifies common tropes or characters that take part in this meta-narrative. For instance, the young hero, the wise old man or woman, the goddess, the temptress and the shadowy antagonist, that he relates to archetypes. He suggests that such myths and stories have a narrative structure that mirrors or echoes the psychological structure of the mind, which is the reason of their power.

\caption{The 12 archetypes and the specific 'universal needs' that they address, grouped by their orientation (ego, order, freedom and social) and type (based on their 'driving source'): the diagonal archetypes (outline in black) correspond to the Self type, the vertical archetypes (outlined in white) to the Ego type, and the horizontal archetypes (outlined in grey) to the Soul type.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-10}
\end{figure}

This framework has been complexified, grouping these twelve archetypes into sets, for instance by classifying them into three types relative to their ``driving source''. For instance, the \emph{Ego} type (Innocent, Orphan, Hero and Caregiver) is driven to fulfil ego-defined agendas and \emph{mutatis mutandis} for the \emph{Soul} (Explorer, Rebel, Lover and Creator) and \emph{Self} (Jester, Sage, Magician and Ruler) types.

Additionally to the type, these archetypes can also be clustered according to their orientation on a two-dimensional plane with four cardinal points, which are \emph{Ego} (leaving a mark on the world), \emph{Order} (providing structure), \emph{Freedom} (yearning for paradise) and \emph{Social} (connecting to others), creating pairs of opposite (Social and Freedom being opposed to Ego Order, respectively).

The type and the orientation are additive groupings. For example, the Caregiver, being of the Ego-type, is driven by the need to fulfil ego agendas, through meeting the needs of others (characterising its social orientation). In a different way, the Hero, also driven by the same need to fulfil ego agendas, does so through courageous action that proves self-worth (characterising its ego orientation).

Finally, each of these twelve archetypes is addressing a specific ``universal Human need'', namely \emph{safety} (the Innocent), \emph{belonging} (the Orphan), \emph{mastery} (the Hero), \emph{service} (the Caregiver), \emph{freedom} (the Explorer), \emph{liberation} (the Rebel), \emph{intimacy} (the Lover), \emph{innovation} (the Creator), \emph{pleasure} (the Jester), \emph{understanding} (the Sage), \emph{power} (the Magician) and \emph{control} (the Ruler).

However, it is important to note that the framework proposed by \citet{mark2001hero} was initially created with companies in mind rather than individuals \emph{per se}, to help new business developing their brand by increasing their identification with specific archetypes. This archetypal branding could facilitate, supposedly, directly communicating with the potential client's unconscious in order to sell more products. This is followed by attempts to attribute dominant archetypes to existing brands. This perspective and usage of archetypes is, in our humble opinion, quite nonsensical in regards with science.

The coach Scott Jeffrey, after disguising random information as facts (e.g., \emph{``archetypes influence 99\% of human behavior''}), ends up with a list of \href{https://scottjeffrey.com/archetypes-list/}{over 325} archetypes (!), suggesting that their number is even larger (\emph{``the reality is that there are thousands of archetypes. Each one possesses different behavioral patterns and subtleties''}). Besides the uselessness of an infinitely fined-grained concept, these classifications (that the author defines himself as \emph{``set patterns of behavior''}) are clearly different from archetypes as conceptualised in this book.

One major stream of critiques is directed at Jung himself, for his alleged ethnocentrism, racism, colonial mindset, and sympathies for the Nazi regime (see this REFERENCE for an overview of the critiques). But what is more relevant for the topic at hand are the issues pertaining to his developpment of the concept of archetypes.

The psychologist James Hillman suggested to eliminate the noun archetype altogether, while preserving the adjective \emph{archetypal}.

Another possibility is to try to redefine archetypes precisely, and redefine them in a way that makes compatible with scientific investigation and useful for theory or practice (as archetypes are one of the tools used in psychoanalytical therapy). This is the aim of the next chapter.

\hypertarget{universal-truths-about-humans}{%
\section{Universal Truths about Humans}\label{universal-truths-about-humans}}

One of the semi-hidden assumption behind archetypes is that there is some commonalities to Human experience, and that recurring patterns of thought and behaviour are not the mere result of chance or random evolution, but rather has a common origin, whether it is ``innate'' (as a core property of our mental functioning) or ``acquired'' through exchanges and learning (or, as often, a mix of both). Thus, it is unsuprising that one of the main line of critique of archetypes (and also, of comparative mythology), aims at this will to find, and bias in favour of, shared characteristics rather than differences and nuances.

Where does a neuroscientific archetypism place itself? As per its name, the assumption that we hold is that archetypes, if they exist, are products of the brain and, by extension, are tied to the structural similarities that we share as Humans.

\hypertarget{from-theory-to-application}{%
\section{From Theory to Application}\label{from-theory-to-application}}

Following Jung's work, many archetype theorists have adopted a ``bottom-up approach'', i.e., starting from observations to infer the cause (the nature of archetypes). Observations are gathered by exploring various cultures, myths, religions or the depths of Human's psyche (using tools of pseudo-access such as psychoanalysis or hypnosis). In this framework, the archetypist's role is to assemble and integrate the interpretations emerging from these observations, in a theory that could be applied to explain these observations.

In this book, we will take the opposite approach. Based on scientific knowledge about evolution, biology and neuroscience, we will outline a plausible framework, that we will then test on observations and facts.

\hypertarget{a-falsifiable-theory}{%
\section{A Falsifiable Theory}\label{a-falsifiable-theory}}

The fundamental issue of psychoanalysis is that it is not a scientific theory, which requires a possibility of falsification. For example, Newton's law of gravity could easily be falsified if, for instance, the apple did not fall from the tree but levitated there (and it has been later falsified by astronomical observations, and eventually replaced, by Einstein's set of theories). On the contrary, every observation is evidence in favour of psychoanalysis, and the same can unfortunately be said for Jungian's approach.

This pseudoscientific nature is particularly relevant for the Jungian conceptualisation of archetypes, which suffers from a structural and inherent unscientificalness. In metaphorical terms, we could say that it is an \emph{ouroboros} (the symbol of a dragon/serpent eating its own tail): the natural ``consequences'' of archetypes (i.e., the manifest patterns and motifs that we observe in myths, stories, religions\ldots) are also, in theory, the ``cause'' of them. In other words, the existence of numerous instances of wise old men is brandished as the one of the only possible manifest proof for the existence of the archetype of the wise old man. And the redundancy of this motif is also what perpetuates its archetypal nature. The serpent eats itself, and the existence of this archetype, as it is tied only to a given existing observation, is unfalsifiable. On an abstract level, if \emph{B} is the cause of \emph{C}, scientists would investigate the cause(s) and origin(s) of \emph{B}, let it be \emph{A}, so that \emph{A} ‚Üí \emph{B} ‚Üí \emph{C}. The system has a clear causal structure. For archetypes, the current approach suggests that \emph{A} \textless-\textgreater{} \emph{B}: archetypal images are made \emph{manifest} (observable, and thus measurable) as they are filled with a idiosyncratic content (depending on the culture, beliefs, personal experience etc.). Hence, we cannot demonstrate that archetypes do not exist, because every motif is potentially a proof in favour of an archetype.

\end{figure}

Therefore, how to scientifically test (and refute) archetypism is the core question of any scientific approach to archetypism. Thus, after outlining our perspective on archetypes in the following chapters, we will propose practical ways to assess their existence and role in society and individuals.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

One practical limitation of our approach is that some of the data is already known, which makes it hard to blindly derive predictions from a model that one could later test. For instance, if we postulate that archetypical motives could be present within the similarities of myths, stories and religions, it is hard not to be inspired and influenced by the existing facts. Even with good theoretical reasons, it appears as complicated to postulate the existence of a given archetypal motif if we know in advance that its presence in Human productions is very seldom. Our cultural environment influences its theorization. Although it is also the case in other scientific fields, it might be stronger when it comes to archetypes, as they are particularly deeply connected with cultural manifestations.

Another, more fundamental, angle of attack concerns the practical value of over-specific and over-generic archetypes. As we have seen in previous examples, some authors proposed a list of archetypes so vast that their usefulness and relevance as a scientific concept is limited. On the other hand, others authors (including Jung) emphasize quite generic figures, such as ``the father'' or ``the mother''. The issue with this is that the fact that that these figures and concepts are critically important in Human culture cannot be used as a evidence in favour of their archetypicity. Yes, a loving mother and a fearless father are common tropes in Human existence. One could thus wonder about the relevance of creating a whole theory around them. Thus, finding the right level, the sweet spot, between specificity and genericity, appears as an important challenge for our endeveour.

\hypertarget{what-are-archetypes}{%
\section{What are Archetypes?}\label{what-are-archetypes}}

We define archetypes as the product of the essentialisation of the space created by the fundamental axes that structure a cognitive system. These axes create layers of opposed poles that are tied to important concepts for adaptation and survival. For example, one possible axis would give rise to the concepts (the centroids of the spaces created by this axis) of life and death, a distinction arguably critical to Humans. In this example, the process of archetypalisation would essentialise these spaces (or proto-concepts), for instance to features or symbols (e.g., the tree, the heart, the skull).

But these examples are not necessarily ``true'' archetypes. Indeed, compared to other results of essentialisation, true archetypes present some specific characteristics. Their ontogenic origin can be traced to the early stages of development (roughly equivalent to children in Humans). They are usually primitive (or ``raw''), in the sense that they require minimal cognitive ability to be created. They are efficient, encapsulating and conveying complex meaning in the most effective form. They are important for adaptation and survival, allowing for the easy integration of important notions. They are meta-stable relative to a given spatio-temporal context, meaning that individuals growing in a similar environment (without necessarily communicating between them) should exhibit similar forms of archetypes (as these are essentialised in relation to the interaction between an individual and its environment).

As a consequence, archetypes (in our definition) are not universal and can present variations in their presentations depending on the geographical and temporal context. Nevertheless, the proto-concepts that they are attached to might be similar. For example, the essentialisation of the concept of life and death might manifest under different forms: a society were a given animal is the main cause of death may use it as its symbol, compared to another society in which death is best exemplified through something else. That being said, a society where death does not exist (in which the life and death distinction is useless) might not display any (pseudo)archetype for it.

Archetypes are neither collective \emph{per se}. They do not emanate or emerge from some shared memories or history, other than the similarities of our lives. They are deeply and inherently individual, and their collective aspect (as they are usually shared within a given culture) is merely a reflection of the ontogenic and evolutionary redundancies.

\hypertarget{essentialisation}{%
\section{Essentialisation}\label{essentialisation}}

Essentialisation is the core mechanism underlying the existence and creation of archetypes. Essentialisation is in general achieved either through biomorphism (in particular, anthropomorphism), giving Human or animal-like aspect to objects, or symbolification, reducing a concept to a (usually visual) symbol. The mode of essentialisation might depend on cognitive abilities (abstraction / imagery abilities) and environment (prevalence of natural or abstract objects).

arch√©type secondaire (activ√©s) = activ√©s par l'exp√©rience precoces (sur un mod√®le epigenetique)

\hypertarget{the-main-archetypes}{%
\chapter{The Main Archetypes}\label{the-main-archetypes}}

\textbf{\emph{Warning:} This is a work in progress, i.e., currently just a collection of unstructured information.}

The main archetypes discussed in this chapter reffered to as ``axial archetypes'', as they emerge from to the axes that structure our mental system. As this system grows and complexifies, its dimensionality increases, creating new planes and providing more coordinates to navigate in this space. As a result of the densification of this matrix, archetypes become more subtler, fine-grained and ultimately fading into the unicity that is characterising our identity.

Thus, archetypes are usually paired (as they are the two spaces created separated by a line), creating a symmetric and hierarchical structure. Importantly, they can be identified, and grouped, relative to their causing axis, which is often an important distinction that the organism has to learn in order to adapt.

Thus, evidence for archetypes can be indirectly gathered by demonstrating the existence and relevance of their axis of reference.

\hypertarget{masculine-and-feminine}{%
\section{Masculine and Feminine}\label{masculine-and-feminine}}

Existing theories and models often associate archetpyes with specific genders, namely ``feminine'' and ``masculine''. While this will also be the case in the current book, the reader must be aware that we see it mainly as a flexible (and convenient) appelation. In the archetypal framework, the Masculine and Feminine adjectives do not directly refer, nor are limited, to their respective biological genders, but rather to features of the two primordial archetypes, the father and the mother (see below). That does not preclude that a masculine archetype can be embodied by a female figure and \emph{vice versa}.

Moreover, another limitation of this pseudo-sexualised perspective is that it is, to some extent, anthropomorphic or primatomorphic (or at least mammalomorphic). Indeed, in these classes and families, males often endorse the role of protection, fighting for females through which reproduction can be achieved. However, other taxa of animals, with different reproduction systems, might have these roles changed, or reversed. For instance, in ants, the ruler and the warriors are Females, whereas the males are typically exhibiting roles that would be anthropomorphically labeled as feminine. Thus, while we will keep using Masculine and Feminine in their primatal sense, these adjectives may not be universally relevant.

\hypertarget{the-two-worlds}{%
\section{The Two Worlds}\label{the-two-worlds}}

The Outside \emph{vs.} the Inside, or the external and internal worlds (or Self vs.~non-Self), is the first axis differenciating our proto-experience.

Transcendal vs.~Natural.

The newborn is a fragile and dependent entity, which safety depends on the \emph{Mother} and the \emph{Father}. These are the first

Both are vectors of \textbf{protection}. The father protects from the outside world, unknown and dangerous, while the mother protects from internal dangers by fullfilling biological needs (hunger, thirst, affection, \ldots). Common mistake is to consider that only father is protection. mother is a protective figure too, and can be one of the fiercest \href{https://doi.org/10.1101/827626}{(e.G., Jessen, 2019)}.

These two primordial archetypes will create the primordial axis, external vs.~internal worlds.

A secondary axis could be the real vs.~the unreal.

For elderly figures, this is assimilated with the place in the society, whether inside (priest, matron) or outside (hermit and witch). For young figures, this reflects the societal and cultural judgment. The hero and the virgin are pure archetypes of virtue, whereas the wanderer and the whore are usually societal and cultural outcasts.

\hypertarget{order}{%
\section{Order}\label{order}}

At one point, the realisation comes that all these figures are subordinated to an overarching ordering and structuring force, the \emph{Ruler}. Altough this archetype has often been related or embodied by Masculine entities, it does not need to be so, as it highly depends on societal and biologoical factors (related to the culture or Specie concerned). For instance, due to the cultural and political system of the western world (for instance, feodalism), the ruler position was generally connected to some level of physical protection offered (hence the king was usually glorified as a great warrior).

\section{Archetypes as Neurocognitive Invariants}\label{archetypes-as-neurocognitive-invariants}}

contrary to Jung, these archetypes are not originating from some collective unconscious, but rather are created and maintained by the ontology of the individual, and patterns are crystilised out of the r√©p√©tition and similarity accross individual ontologies (e.g., the presnece of a fatherly and a motherly figure, etc.)

\hypertarget{neurological-substrate}{%
\section{Neurological Substrate}\label{neurological-substrate}}

Attempts have been made to map archetypes unto brain structures \citep{samuels2003jung}. For instance, \citet{rossi1977cerebral} suggested that one could locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere, based on the idea that the left hemisphe would be primarily verbal and associational, and the right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. In light of the current neuroscientific data, these theories appear as nonsensical and naive.

That being said, if archetypes are engrammed into the cognitive system, a biological basis has to exist. One potential answer is to reframe archetypism under the predictive coding framework. As such, archetypes could be seen as meta-priors.

The eruption would have been so strong that it would have clouded the sky with ashes all over the planet, creating a sudden drop of temperatures (possibly causing a so-called nuclear winter). It is interesting that in other parts of the world, the mythological cataclysm takes the form of a great winter (\emph{Fimbulvetr} in norse mythology)
